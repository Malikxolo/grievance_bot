First, the user query is: "what is weatherin lucknow give me in depth by analying aqi and humidity". I need to correct the typos: it's "weather in Lucknow" and "analyzing AQI and humidity". So, they want the weather in Lucknow, with an in-depth analysis including AQI (Air Quality Index) and humidity.

Now, I must think step by step using the multi-dimensional reasoning approach.

1. **WHAT DOES THE USER REALLY WANT?**
   - Literally: Current weather in Lucknow, including AQI and humidity.
   - Beyond literal: They might be planning an outdoor activity, concerned about health (due to AQI), or need detailed environmental data. Emotional state could be casual or slightly urgent if they're checking for immediate plans. It's one request but has multiple components: weather, AQI, humidity.

2. **INFORMATION QUALITY CHECK - THINK BEYOND THE OBVIOUS**
   - If I just give current weather, AQI, and humidity, is that complete? Probably not. They asked for "in-depth" analysis, so I should provide more context.
   - What did they not mention? Possibly temperature trends, forecasts, health implications of AQI, how humidity affects comfort, comparisons to other cities, or recommendations based on the data.
   - Alternatives: Other weather metrics like wind speed, precipitation, UV index.
   - Related information: How to interpret AQI levels, best times to go out based on weather, historical data.
   - Multi-dimensional thinking:
     - Explicit need: Current weather, AQI, humidity in Lucknow.
     - Implicit need: Health advice, activity suggestions, forecast for planning.
     - Alternatives: Other locations or times.
     - Context: Lucknow's climate, seasonal norms, air quality trends.

   Mental process: User asks for weather with AQI and humidity. So, dimensions could be:
     - Current weather data (temperature, humidity, etc.)
     - AQI details (levels, pollutants, health effects)
     - Humidity impact (comfort level, dew point)
     - Forecast for future planning
     - Historical context or averages
     - Health recommendations based on AQI and humidity
     - Comparisons or trends

   I should create separate searches for each dimension.

3. **IS THIS A BUSINESS PROBLEM?**
   - This seems like a personal query about weather. Not directly related to business, customer support, or automation. No indication of business context. So, probably not a business problem. I'll set business_opportunity.detected to false.

4. **MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TASK BREAKDOWN**
   - Step 1: Literally asked for weather in Lucknow with AQI and humidity analysis.
   - Step 2: Implied: Need for comprehensive environmental data, health insights, maybe planning advice.
   - Step 3: Alternatives: Other metrics, forecasts.
   - Step 4: Related: Climate info, safety tips.
   - Step 5: Expert touch: Include health advisories, trend analysis.

   Dimensions I identified:
     - Current weather conditions in Lucknow
     - Current AQI in Lucknow
     - Current humidity levels and effects
     - Weather forecast for Lucknow
     - AQI interpretation and health impacts
     - Humidity comfort levels
     - Historical weather/AQI data for context
     - Recommendations based on data

   For a complex query, I should aim for 5-7 searches. Let's list them:
     - web_search_0: "Lucknow weather today 2025" (for current weather)
     - web_search_1: "Lucknow AQI today 2025" (for air quality)
     - web_search_2: "Lucknow humidity levels 2025" (for humidity)
     - web_search_3: "Lucknow weather forecast 2025" (for forecast)
     - web_search_4: "AQI health effects Lucknow" (for interpretation)
     - web_search_5: "humidity comfort index" (for context)
     - web_search_6: "Lucknow climate averages" (for historical context)

   That's 7 searches, which seems generous. I can consolidate if needed, but the instruction is to be generous and not merge dimensions.

   Also, since this is time-sensitive (weather changes), I must use web_search to validate current data. Base data for definitions, but current info needs web_search.

5. **HOW TO FORMAT QUERIES**
   - For web_search: Short, keyword-focused, under 6-8 words, include year 2025.
   - For rag: If business context, but here it's not, so probably no rag needed.

6. **TOOL ORCHESTRATION**
   - Tools available: web_search, rag, calculator.
   - This query doesn't need rag since no business context.
   - No calculations needed, so calculator not required.
   - All web_search queries can run in parallel since they don't depend on each other.

7. **HOW SHOULD THE RESPONSE FEEL?**
   - User's tone: Casual, with typos ("weatherin", "analying"), so probably casual or slightly rushed.
   - Personality: Helpful, informative, perhaps empathetic if health concerns.
   - Detail: Comprehensive since they asked for "in-depth".
   - Language: Casual English or Hinglish, but since it's a weather query, professional might be fine, but casual could be better.

Now, for the JSON structure:

- multi_task_analysis: Is this multiple tasks? Yes, it involves weather, AQI, humidity. So, sub_tasks: ["current weather data", "AQI analysis", "humidity analysis"]
- semantic_intent: Overall goal is to get detailed environmental conditions in Lucknow for informed decision-making.
- expansion_reasoning: Why I'm adding more searches – because user asked for in-depth analysis, so need to cover multiple dimensions.
- business_opportunity: Detected false, as it's personal.
- tools_to_use: ["web_search"] since no rag or calculator needed.
- tool_execution: Mode parallel, order doesn't matter, dependency reason empty.
- enhanced_queries: List of web_search queries.
- tool_reasoning: Why these tools – web_search for current, changing data.
- sentiment: Primary emotion casual, intensity medium (not urgent, but detailed request).
- response_strategy: Personality helpful_dost, length detailed, language casual or English, tone friendly.
- key_points_to_address: List the main points to cover in response.

Key points:
- Current temperature, conditions
- AQI level and what it means
- Humidity percentage and comfort
- Forecast
- Health tips if AQI is poor
- General advice

Now, ensure JSON is exact.

Final checks:
- Did I find all dimensions? Yes, I think so.
- Am I generous? 7 searches for web_search.
- Proper key names: rag_0 if used, but not, so only web_search.
- For complex queries, at least 5-7 searches: I have 7.
- Exact JSON structure.

Output only JSON.
